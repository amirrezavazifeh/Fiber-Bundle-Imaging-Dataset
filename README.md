# Fiber Bundle Imaging Dataset

This repository provides the simulated and experimental datasets used in our fiber bundle imaging experiments. All simulated and experimental captures from our imaging setup are publicly available.  

- For the **simulated data**, aligned ground truth images are provided.  
- For the **experimental data**, ground truth is not available due to acquisition constraints; however, all misaligned raw images used in the experiments are included.

## Simulated Data

The simulated dataset was generated by applying random Brownian motion to a raw image to produce a sequence of 20 frames. Each frame was then multiplied by a fiber mask (see figure below) to emulate the sampling characteristics of a fiber bundle imaging system. Aligned ground truth corresponding to these simulated sequences is provided.

**Simulation procedure:**

## Experimental Data

Two scenarios are included:

1. **2D scene:** The same procedure used for the simulated data was applied to generate 20 frames, displayed on a screen and subsequently captured using our imaging setup.  
2. **3D object:** The object was manually moved relative to the imaging probe to acquire 20 frames from different viewpoints.

**Experimental acquisition procedure:**
