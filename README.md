This repository provides the simulated and experimental datasets used in our fiber bundle imaging experiments. All simulated and experimental captures from our imaging setup are publicly available. For the simulated data, aligned ground truth images are provided. For the experimental data, ground truth is not available due to acquisition constraints; however, all misaligned raw images used in the experiments are included.

The simulated dataset was generated by applying random Brownian motion to a raw image to produce a sequence of 20 frames. Each frame was then multiplied by a fiber mask (see Fig.~\ref{fig:burst_capturing}) to emulate the sampling characteristics of a fiber bundle imaging system. Aligned ground truth corresponding to these simulated sequences is provided. The overall simulation procedure is illustrated in Simulation.png.

For the experimental data, two scenarios are included. In the 2D scene, the same procedure used for the simulated data was applied to generate 20 frames, which were displayed on a screen and subsequently captured using our imaging setup. In the 3D scene, the object was manually moved relative to the imaging probe to acquire 20 frames from different viewpoints. The experimental acquisition procedure is illustrated in Experimental.pdf. An image of the imaging setup is also provided and can be included as a figure in this repository.
